There have been many instances of counterfeit products across the globe and this issue is
increasing day by day on a large scale. So, to prevent this problem, this project designed to
help a person to detect the duplicate products sold out in the market, under the name
branded companies like Adidas, Nike, Bata etc. This technology can mainly be used while
offline shopping and to be aware about the product if it is of the original brand or any
duplicate copy of it. This android app will ask the user to select the brand of the company
for which scanning is to be done and then scan the logo of the product using the scanner
and finally let the customer know if the product is real or a counterfeit product
